# PDF-Query-App-Local-RAG-System-
This repository contains a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for querying PDF documents. It leverages state-of-the-art NLP and ML tools for efficient and accurate information retrieval.  
Here we've used all the free resources:  
Ollama with powerful llama3, ollamaembeddings for embedding, faiss as a vectordb, Streamlit framework for the UI design  
Everything is free runs locally, need a slightly powerful machine for better processing.  
Hope you'll like this :)
